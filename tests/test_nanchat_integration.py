"""Integration test: swap nanoops into nanchat's actual GPT.

Builds a tiny nanchat GPT, runs it twice with identical seeds and data:
once with PyTorch's torch.nn.functional, once with nanoops swapped into
nanchat's `F` namespace via `nanoops.integration.patched()`. Compares the
loss curves to verify nanoops produces numerically identical results when
dropped into the real nanchat training loop.

Patch scope is defined in `nanoops/integration.py` (single source of truth;
the same hook is used by `scripts/base_train.py` when `NANOOPS=1` is set).
