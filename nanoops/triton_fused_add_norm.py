"""FusedAddNorm Triton kernels + shared TileConfig sizing utility.

`y = norm(x + residual)` with `summed = x + residual` returned as a side
output for the next block's residual stream. See `fused_add_norm` and
TRITON_zh.md Chapter 2.

Also hosts the shared `TileConfig` / `_pick_tile_config` sizing helper.
The sibling Triton modules in this package import what they need from
here:
  - `triton_fused_mlp_block.py` imports `_pick_tile_config` (sizes its
    Step 0 RMSNorm) and `_fused_add_norm_fwd_kernel` (the kernel itself,
    reused with HAS_RESIDUAL=False).
  - `triton_fused_attn_qkv.py` is self-contained (own RMSNorm backward
    helper) — no imports from here yet, kept as an option for future
    cross-file reuse.

Re-exported through `nanoops.triton_kernels` for backward-compat callers.

# Fused residual-add + RMSNorm — placed at block boundaries:
#     y_new = norm(x + residual)
#
# Forward: two consecutive elementwise passes that share the same
# (M, D) tile layout, so fusion is a clean win — one HBM read of
# (x, residual), one write of y, plus a residual-stream write of
# summed = x + residual (which the next block needs anyway and the
# backward kernel also consumes).
#
# Backward: two paths, dispatched in `_fused_add_norm_bwd_impl` based
# on whether the inline kernel's per-program tile fits in the 255 fp32
# reg/thread cap (checked via TileConfig.fits_reg_budget):
#   Primary — _fused_add_norm_bwd_inline_kernel: single-pass, full
#     row in one tile, inner reduction computed in registers. Used
#     whenever it fits (covers all nanchat shapes). Wins 1.5–2.4× over
#     the 2-kernel path on common D.
#   Fallback — _fused_add_norm_inner_kernel + _fused_add_norm_bwd_kernel:
#     Flash-Attention style 2-pass (pre-compute inner[m], then 2D-tile
#     grid over (M, D) for d_summed + dnw_partial). Engages when inline
#     would spill (HAS_NW=True at D ≥ 16K).
#   Both paths fold d_summed_external (caller's direct gradient w.r.t.
#   summed) into the kernel's d_summed store, saving an extra Python
#   `+` op + its HBM round-trip.
#
# Cheap, useful at the seam between attn-block output and mlp-block
# norm-input. See TRITON_zh.md Chapter 2.

        """RMSNorm backward second-stage kernel (paired with
        `_fused_add_norm_inner_kernel` which pre-computes inner[m]).

        The `ynorm_src_ptr` tensor is interpreted based on HAS_NW:
          - HAS_NW=True : pointer is to `summed`; kernel reconstructs
            y_norm = summed * rms_inv inline (one multiply per loaded
            tile, runs on idle FP32 cores). Used so fwd doesn't need a
            separate 2·M·D HBM write for y_norm.
          - HAS_NW=False: pointer is to `y` itself, which equals y_norm
            (since `y = summed * rms_inv * 1` when there's no per-channel
            affine). Kernel uses it directly — saves the multiply.

        Grid is 2D (M_tile × D_tile): each program produces one
        (BLOCK_M × BLOCK_D) slice of d_summed and writes one
        (BLOCK_M × BLOCK_D) partial of dnw. Splitting along D keeps
        per-program register pressure manageable (vs a 1D-over-M grid
        which would force the whole D into a single tile and spill).

        `inner_ptr` is the per-row reduction `inner[m] = mean_d(g_eff *
        y_norm)`, pre-computed by `_fused_add_norm_inner_kernel`. This
        avoids each d_tile program recomputing the same full-D reduction
        (would be D/BLOCK_D × redundant otherwise).

        `d_ext_ptr` is the gradient w.r.t. `summed` coming from outside
        (caller's direct consumption of summed as residual stream). The
        kernel adds it to the RMSNorm-bwd-computed gradient in pass 2
        so the final `d_summed` already contains the total — saves an
        extra Python torch elementwise add + its HBM round-trip
        (~50 μs/call at d24 shape).

        Math (when HAS_NW=True; `dy` is gradient of the fwd-output `y`):
          y_norm[m, d]   = summed[m, d] * rms_inv[m]
          g_eff[m, d]    = dy[m, d] * nw[d]
          d_summed[m, d] = rms_inv[m] * (g_eff - y_norm * inner[m]) + d_ext[m, d]
          dnw_partial[m_tile, d] = sum_{m in tile} (dy * y_norm)

        When HAS_NW=False: y_norm[m, d] = ynorm_src[m, d] directly,
        g_eff collapses to dy, dnw_partial is not produced; nw_ptr
        and dnw_partial_ptr are not dereferenced.

        Precision: same bf16-product + fp32-accumulator pattern as the
        inline + inner kernels — bf16 inputs read native, fp32 promotion
        happens via auto-promote on multiplies against fp32 tensors
        (rms_inv, inner) and via explicit `dtype=fp32` on `tl.sum`.

    """Fused `y = norm(x + residual)`. Also returns `summed = x + residual`
    so the caller can plug it directly into the next block's residual
    stream (no re-add needed).

    Pass `norm_weight=None` for RMSNorm without a per-channel affine
    scale (plain `summed / RMS(summed)`).

    The canonical block-boundary fusion: between an attn block's output
    and the mlp block's norm-input (or symmetrically between mlp output
    and the next layer's attn norm-input).

    Implemented as a `torch.library.custom_op` (with register_fake +
    register_autograd) so torch.compile keeps the op as an opaque FX node
    instead of breaking the graph at the call — see
    `_fused_add_norm_fwd_impl` / `_fused_add_norm_bwd_impl` for the actual
    kernel call sequences.

    Args:
      x: (M, D) contiguous CUDA tensor.
      residual: (M, D) contiguous CUDA tensor.
      norm_weight: optional (D,) RMSNorm scale.
      eps: RMSNorm epsilon.

    Returns:
      (y, summed), both (M, D) tensors with x.dtype."""
    # custom_op returns (y, summed, rms_inv); rms_inv is saved-for-backward
    # only, so we drop it here and return the original (y, summed) shape.
