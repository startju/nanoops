# Launch base_train with nanoops swapped into nanchat's F namespace.
#
# What this does: sets NANOOPS=1 (the env var that scripts/base_train.py
# reads to call nanoops.integration.patch_nanchat() at startup), then
# launches a d24 base-training run sized for 2× RTX 3090.
#
# Usage:
#   bash nanoops/train.sh                       # defaults below
#   bash nanoops/train.sh --num-iterations=10   # pass extra args through
#   NPROC=4 bash nanoops/train.sh               # override GPU count
#   WANDB_RUN=myrun bash nanoops/train.sh       # enable wandb logging
#
# Compared to runs/speedrun.sh this is just the base_train step in isolation
# (no tokenizer / dataset / SFT / eval) — meant for iterating on nanoops
# itself, not for end-to-end training.

# forward in backward). Cost: 0.62 s/GiB freed, strictly better than

# NPROC=1: launch via plain python (NOT torchrun). torchrun unconditionally
# sets RANK / LOCAL_RANK / WORLD_SIZE in env, which makes nanchat's
# is_ddp_requested() return True and Factory pick DistMuonAdamW. We want
# single-GPU to use the simpler MuonAdamW class — both because it's the
# right tool for the job and because nanoops.cpu_offload's
# patched_step_adamw / patched_step_muon (which handle the GPU-transient
# release dance that single-GPU memory pressure needs) live on MuonAdamW.
# Going via DistMuonAdamW for single-GPU wires through patched_compute_*
# which is missing those single-GPU mitigations.
#
# `python -u` forces unbuffered stdout — torchrun's launcher does this
# automatically, but plain python block-buffers stdout when redirected
# to a file, so step lines / patch list would never appear in the log
# until the buffer fills or the process exits.
