# nanoops Triton Kernels

A walkthrough of writing fused GPU kernels in Triton, targeting the
RTX 3090. Written for someone new to Triton who wants to understand
**why the fusion choices in `nanoops/triton_kernels.py` look the way
they do** — block sizes are picked against actual 3090 budgets,
fusion boundaries follow from the chip's compute/bandwidth ratio,
and what to keep in registers vs save in ctx vs recompute is driven
by the same arithmetic-intensity tradeoffs.

The doc starts from raw hardware numbers (SM count, shared mem,
register file) and works up to fused-kernel design. By the end you
should be able to read any kernel in `triton_kernels.py` and see
why every choice was made.

## Chapter 1 — Target hardware: RTX 3090 (Ampere SM_86 / GA102)

Every block-size choice, every "fits in shared memory" check, every
"why is this a separate kernel and not one giant fused kernel" trade-off
below is keyed to these numbers. If you port to a different GPU
(RTX 4090 / A100 / H100 / consumer Ada), most kernels will run, but the
tile sizes are likely no longer optimal.

### Whole-chip totals

| Item                | Value                |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| **SMs**             | **82**               |
| Total FP32 cores    | 82 × 128 = 10,496    |
| Total Tensor cores  | 82 × 4 = 328         |
| Total register file | 82 × 64K = 5.4 M regs|
| Total shared mem    | 82 × 100 KB = 8.2 MB |
| **Device memory**   | **24 GB GDDR6X**     |
| HBM bandwidth       | **936 GB/s**         |
| Compute capability  | **8.6**              |

### Per-SM resources

| Resource                | Value           | Notes                                     |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| L1 / shared memory      | 128 KB combined | zero-sum split: `shared_carveout + L1 = 128 KB`; sm_86 allowed shared values are `{0, 8, 16, 32, 64, 100} KB` — selecting 100 KB shared leaves only 28 KB L1 |
| Shared mem **per SM**    | **100 KB**     | max carveout = total pool shared by all co-resident blocks |
| Shared mem **per block** | **100 KB**     | hardware cap on what a single block can request — equal to the per-SM pool size (so a single block can hog all of it if it wants, but that means blocks/SM = 1) |
| Registers per SM        | 65,536 × 32-bit | = 256 KB; per-thread allocation, all active threads on SM share this pool → caps both active-thread count AND blocks/SM (via thread count) |
| Max threads / SM        | 1,536           | = 48 warps; caps blocks/SM as `1536 / threads_per_block` |
| Max blocks / SM         | 16              | hardware cap on number of co-resident blocks regardless of resources |
| Tensor cores            | 4 (3rd gen)     | bf16 / fp16 / tf32 / int8                 |
| FP32 cores              | 128             |                                           |
| Warp size               | 32 threads      |                                           |

### Per-block limits

(NVIDIA's full term is "thread block"; "block" is the standard shorthand
used in CUDA APIs — `blockDim`, `blockIdx`, `<<<grid, block>>>` — and in
the rest of this doc.)

| Limit              | Value      |
| ------------------ | ---------- |
| Max threads        | 1024 (32 warps) |
| Max shared memory  | **100 KB** |
| Max registers/thread | 255 (more → spill to local memory, slow) |

### Compile-time vs runtime: what's frozen when

A central fact that makes the rest of this chapter make sense:
**almost everything that constrains occupancy is frozen at compile
time**, not at launch.

| Quantity                  | Decided when    | Decided by              |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------- |
| `threads_per_block`       | **compile time** | user (via `num_warps` × 32 for Triton, or `<<<grid, block>>>` for CUDA C++) |
| `reg/thread`              | **compile time** | compiler (Triton / NVCC) after static analysis of the kernel body |
| `shared_mem / block`      | **compile time** | compiler (static sum of all `tl.load` buffers, accumulators, `num_stages` pipeline depth) |
| `grid_dim` (block count)  | runtime         | user — `kernel[grid](...)` |
| `blocks/SM`               | runtime         | hardware (GigaThread Engine); see exact formula below |
| Which SM each block lands on | runtime      | hardware (GigaThread Engine) |

What this implies:

- A single Triton kernel definition compiles to **N separate binaries**
  if you sweep `num_warps`, `num_stages`, or `BLOCK_*` via
  `triton.autotune` — each binary has its own frozen `reg/thread` and
  `shared/block`.
- `reg/thread` is *not* something the user can pick directly; you only
  influence it indirectly by writing a smaller / larger / more
  pipelined kernel.
- Once compiled, occupancy is **deterministic per kernel** — the
  hardware doesn't reshuffle resources at runtime.

The exact formula the GigaThread Engine uses, in warp terms (warp =
the actual scheduling unit, **NOT** thread):

```
warps_per_block = ⌈threads_per_block / 32⌉
regs_per_warp   = ⌈(32 · reg_per_thread) / 256⌉ · 256       # 256-align
regs_per_block  = warps_per_block · regs_per_warp

blocks/SM = min(
    16,                                                   # ① hardware block cap
    ⌊48 / warps_per_block⌋,                               # ② per-SM warp cap (= 1536 threads)
    ⌊100 KB / shared_per_block⌋,                          # ③ shared mem pool
    ⌊65,536 / regs_per_block⌋,                            # ④ register file pool
)

resident_warps = blocks/SM · warps_per_block
occupancy      = resident_warps / 48
```

Subtleties:
- **`⌈ / 32⌉` (warp rounding)** — if `threads_per_block` isn't a
  multiple of 32, the last warp still claims a full 32-lane slot
  (with inactive lanes).
- **`⌈ / 256⌉ · 256` (register allocation granularity)** — Ampere
  allocates registers per-warp in chunks of 256. So 32 threads each
  using 33 registers don't claim `32·33 = 1,056`; they claim
  `⌈1,056/256⌉·256 = 1,280` — 224 register slots wasted. The
  effect is invisible at well-tuned `reg_per_thread` values (multiples
  of 8 land cleanly on the 256-per-warp boundary), but real when the
  compiler picks an oddly sized count.
- **`⌊ ⌋` (block count integer)** — the SM can't host 1.5 blocks.
- **② is fundamentally a warp cap** — the 48-warp scheduler limit is
  the hardware constraint; the "1536 thread" framing is just
  `48 × 32`.

### FMA vs MMA — the two primitive ops

Throughput tables below count work in **FMA / MMA / FLOPs**. Worth
nailing down what each means first.

**FMA — Fused Multiply-Add (scalar)**
- The basic op of a CUDA core: `d = a * b + c`
- "Fused" = one rounding step at the end (not two), better numerics
- 1 FMA = **2 FLOPs** (one multiply + one add)
- Every modern CPU/GPU FPU does FMA in 1 cycle; doing `a*b` and `+c`
  separately is the same speed but worse numerics

**MMA — Matrix Multiply-Accumulate (matrix)**
- The basic op of a Tensor core: `C = A @ B + C` where A, B, C are
  small matrices
- Ampere 3rd-gen Tensor core: shape is **16×16×16** (one MMA does the
  product of a 16×16 matrix and a 16×16 matrix, accumulating into a
  16×16 result)
- 1 such MMA = 16 × 16 × 16 = **4,096 multiply-adds = 8,192 FLOPs**
- Issued as a single warp-level `mma.sync` PTX instruction. The 4,096
  multiply-adds are pipelined across multiple cycles per Tensor core —
  per-SM sustained throughput is **1,024 BF16 FLOPs/cycle** (see peak
  compute table below), i.e. each Tensor core does 256 BF16 FLOPs/cycle,
  so one 16×16×16 MMA's work (8,192 FLOPs) amortizes over **~32 cycles**
  per Tensor core.

So one MMA does **the same work as 4,096 FMAs**. That's the asymmetry
that justifies the architectural split: a few Tensor cores running
MMAs >> many CUDA cores running FMAs.

### RTX 3090 peak compute

Boost clock 1695 MHz, 82 SMs.

| Precision / unit                 | Per-SM throughput          | Whole-chip peak     |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| FP32 (CUDA cores)                | 128 cores × 2 FLOPs/cycle  | **35.6 TFLOPS**     |
| TF32 (Tensor cores)              | 512 FLOPs/cycle            | **71 TFLOPS**       |
| **FP16 / BF16 (Tensor cores)**   | 1024 FLOPs/cycle           | **142 TFLOPS**      |
| INT8 (Tensor cores)              | 2048 ops/cycle             | 284 TOPS            |

**Memory side**: 936 GB/s HBM bandwidth. Compute-to-bandwidth ratio at
bf16 = 142 TFLOPS / 936 GB/s = **152 FLOPs per byte**. Any op below
that ratio is bandwidth-bound; above it is compute-bound.

**How arithmetic intensity is computed** (for a matmul `C = A @ B`,
shapes `(M, K) @ (K, N) → (M, N)`, all bf16):

- **FLOPs** = `2·M·N·K` — each output element needs K multiply-adds (each
  multiply-add = 2 FLOPs)
- **Bytes** = `2·(M·K + K·N + M·N)` — read A + read B + write C, 2 bytes
  per bf16 element
- **AI** = FLOPs / Bytes = `M·N·K / (M·K + K·N + M·N)` (the 2's cancel)

The break-even at 152 FLOPs/byte (= 142 TFLOPS / 936 GB/s) tells you
whether the matmul is bottlenecked by GPU compute (above) or HBM
bandwidth (below).

For nanchat-d24 matmuls at training shapes (M=2048, K=1536; N varies):

| Matmul site                | Shape (M, K, N)       | AI (FLOPs/byte) |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------- |
| c_q / c_k / c_v / attn c_proj | (2048, 1536, 1536) | **558**         |
| MLP c_fc (D → 4D)          | (2048, 1536, 6144)    | **770**         |
| MLP c_proj (4D → D)        | (2048, 6144, 1536)    | **770**         |

All comfortably above the 152 FLOPs/byte break-even → **compute-bound**.

**RMSNorm and other elementwise/reduction ops are heavily
bandwidth-bound** — about 100× below break-even. For one row of D
elements:

- FLOPs ≈ `4·D` (mean(x²) = ~2D, then `x · rms_inv · weight` = 2D)
- Bytes (bf16) ≈ `4·D` (**fused** kernel reads x once = 2D, writes y = 2D;
  weight read is `D` per kernel, amortized away). A naive 2-pass
  implementation would read x twice → 6D bytes, AI = 0.67 FLOPs/byte.
  Triton/CUDA kernels keep the row of x in registers across the two
  passes, so HBM only touches it once.
- **AI ≈ 1 FLOPs/byte** — vs 152 break-even, this is bandwidth-bound
  by ~100×

Summary table (training-shape scale):

| Op                          | AI (FLOPs/byte) | Bound      |
| --------------------------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| MLP / QKV matmul            | 558 – 770       | compute    |
| SDPA (B=1, L=2048)          | ~114 naive / ~1024 Flash (see SDPA section below) | bandwidth → compute |
| **RMSNorm**                 | **~1**          | bandwidth  |
| Elementwise (add, relu)     | ~0.5            | bandwidth  |
| Memcpy H2D / D2H            | 0               | bandwidth  |

**Why this motivates the fusion stack:** standalone RMSNorm kernel
does ~4·M·D bytes of HBM traffic for ~0 compute return. Fusing norm
into the adjacent matmul kernel (`fused_mlp_block` on the mlp side,
`NormQKVProjection` on the attn side) keeps the normalized intermediate in registers,
saving **4·M·D bytes** of HBM traffic (norm output write + matmul
input re-read) — pure bandwidth win on a bandwidth-bound op, no
downside. Same idea for fused_add_norm at block boundaries.

**SDPA: why Flash Attention exists.** Same AI lens shows the SDPA
case has *two* numbers depending on whether the `(L, L)` P matrix
gets materialized.

For nanchat d24 (B=1, H=12, L=2048, D_head=128), forward attention
(both matmuls: `Q@K^T` and `attn@V`, plus softmax):

| Implementation                          | Total FLOPs | Total bytes | AI                |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Naive SDPA (materialize P to HBM)       | 25.8 G      | ~226 MB     | **~114 FLOPs/byte** (bandwidth-ish) |
| Flash SDPA (P stays in registers)       | 25.8 G      | ~25 MB      | **~1024 FLOPs/byte** (compute-bound) |

Byte breakdown: at this scale `Q + K + V + O ≈ 25 MB` (4 tensors of
`B·H·L·D = 12·2048·128` bf16 each). The P matrix is `B·H·L·L = 100 MB`,
and naive SDPA writes P then reads it back from HBM (~200 MB), so the
naive total is ~225 MB vs Flash's ~25 MB. Flash's online softmax +
tile streaming keeps P in registers, flipping SDPA from bandwidth-
bound (~114 < 152 break-even) to compute-bound (~1024 >> break-even).

This is why Flash Attention is 2-4× faster than naive SDPA — bytes drop
~9× while FLOPs change only slightly:

- **Forward FLOPs**: nearly identical (~5% more on Flash for the
  online softmax's rescale bookkeeping).
- **Backward FLOPs**: ~33% MORE on Flash, because Flash recomputes
  the P matrix from a fresh `Q @ K^T` instead of saving P. Classic
  FLOPs-for-memory trade.

Net effect: even though Flash backward does ~30% more arithmetic,
the ~10× HBM bandwidth saving dominates wall time (the workload was
bandwidth-bound, so saving bandwidth trumps spending FLOPs). Sliding-
window attention shrinks both bytes and FLOPs proportionally (band
size `W` instead of full `L`), but the Flash-vs-naive ratio stays
the same.

### Tensor cores vs CUDA (FP32) cores

These are **different physical units**, optimized for different work
patterns. Understanding the split changes how you reason about kernel
throughput.

| Unit              | Per SM | What each does (sustained)              | SM throughput               |
| ----------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **FP32 cores**    | 128    | 1 scalar FMA/cycle each = 2 FLOPs/cycle each | **256 FP32 FLOPs/cycle**    |
| **Tensor cores**  | 4      | sustained 256 BF16 FLOPs/cycle each (one 16×16×16 MMA amortized over ~32 cycles) | **1024 BF16 FLOPs/cycle**   |

So 4 Tensor cores deliver ~4× the bf16 throughput that 128 FP32 cores
deliver in fp32 (1024 / 256). Going bf16/fp16 and using `tl.dot`
unlocks that 4×.

**Why only 4 Tensor cores per SM:**

1. **Silicon area.** One Tensor core is ~tens of FP32-cores worth of
   transistors. Four already eats a big slice of the SM die.
2. **Scheduling matches.** An Ampere SM has **4 warp schedulers**;
   each cycle, each scheduler issues one `mma.sync` to one Tensor
   core. 4 schedulers × 4 Tensor cores = perfect 1:1 — adding a fifth
   Tensor core would just sit idle.
3. **Data bandwidth.** At peak (1024 BF16 FLOPs/cycle = 512
   multiply-adds/cycle per SM), even with full tile reuse from
   registers the 4 Tensor cores together still need operand data
   on the order of ~1 KB/cycle out of shared memory — already a
   substantial fraction of the per-SM SMEM port bandwidth.

### Warps, warp schedulers, and which cores actually run

A **warp** = 32 threads. The fundamental scheduling unit.

   └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key relationships:**

- **1 warp issues 1 instruction** at a time. Either to FP32 cores
  (32 lanes × 1 fp32 op = 32 ops in one cycle, one per thread) or to
  a Tensor core (the whole warp cooperates to produce one matrix `mma`).
- A **`mma.sync` instruction is warp-level**, not thread-level — all
  32 threads in the warp participate. Their per-thread register
  fragments concatenate into the (16, 16) matrix tiles the Tensor
  core reads.
- Up to **48 warps can be resident** per SM (= 1536 threads). The
  scheduler picks among them: when one warp stalls on a load, others
  fill the gap. This is **latency hiding** — the reason GPUs don't
  need fancy out-of-order execution like CPUs.
- **Block size matters for occupancy.** A block with 256 threads =
  8 warps. 100 KB shared memory per block → only 1 block fits per SM
  → 8 warps active out of 48 possible → low occupancy → fewer warps
  to hide latency with → throughput drops. Tighter tile sizes (less
  shared mem) let 2-3 blocks co-reside, raising occupancy.

**Triton vs CUDA C++ for warp control:**

- CUDA C++: you explicitly call `__syncwarp()`, manage `mma::sync`,
  pick fragment layouts.
- Triton: hides warps. You only see `tl.program_id` (block-level)
  and `tl.arange` (compile-time vector). Triton's compiler decides
  how to map your vector ops onto 32-thread warps and which lane
  reads which element. You only control:
  - `num_warps=4` (default) — how many warps per block (4 warps =
    128 threads). Bigger = more parallelism per block but fewer
    blocks can co-reside.
  - `num_stages=2` — pipelining depth for `tl.load`/`tl.dot`.

### What this means for our kernels

- **Shared memory budget is the binding constraint.** Most of our
  kernel tile sizes (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N, BLOCK_K) were chosen so the
  combined working set (input tiles + accumulator) fits in ≤ 60–80 KB
  per block, leaving headroom for the runtime and not forcing a
  one-block-per-SM occupancy collapse.

- **3090's shared memory is ~half of A100 (164 KB) and ~third of
  H100 (228 KB).** This is why Flash Attention on 3090 needs smaller
  tile sizes than the canonical Flash kernels published with H100
  numbers. Larger Q/K/V tiles spill or refuse to compile.

- **82 SMs is the rough minimum grid size to saturate the GPU.**
  Anything that launches fewer programs leaves SMs idle. For
  per-row-reduction kernels (RMSNorm, softmax, fused_add_norm),
  we tile along the M (batch × seq) dim because M is typically
  ≥ 2048 in training — comfortable parallelism.

- **No FA3-style TMA / async-copy hardware.** Hopper-specific
  techniques (TMA, distributed shared memory, warp-specialization
  via `wgmma`) aren't usable on Ampere. Our Flash SDPA kernel is the
  classic Triton tutorial pattern, not the FA3 pattern.

- **Fuse elementwise into `tl.dot` epilogues.** Standalone elementwise
  kernels are bandwidth-bound (see RMSNorm / add / relu rows in the AI
  table, all ≪ 152 break-even) — the real cost is HBM round-trip plus
  kernel-launch overhead, not FLOPs. The FP32 cores are mostly idle
  during a `tl.dot`-dominated kernel anyway (a separate elementwise
  pass on them would still cap at ~1/4 of BF16 Tensor peak, 35.6 / 142
  TFLOPS), so folding the elementwise op into the matmul epilogue is a
  free side-channel: it saves the elementwise's HBM round-trip (matmul's
  HBM cost is unchanged), no extra launch, no FLOP/s contention with
  the Tensor cores.

## Chapter 2 — FusedAddNorm: a worked example of 2-op fusion

The simplest fused kernel in this repo. It exists purely as a learning
artifact — nanchat's production blocks fold the RMSNorm directly into
the adjacent matmul (see `NormQKVProjection` on the attn side,
`fused_mlp_block` on the mlp side), so a standalone `add → norm`
op boundary doesn't actually appear in the hot path. But every
pattern this kernel uses is a building block of those bigger fused
kernels, so it's the cleanest place to learn them.

### What it computes

Mathematically:
```
summed = x + residual
y      = summed · rsqrt(mean(summed²) + eps) · weight    # weight optional
```

API returns both `y` and `summed` to the caller:
- `y` → flows to the next block's matmul input
- `summed` → the next block's residual stream (caller doesn't need to
  recompute `x + residual` later)

Four Triton kernels make this work end-to-end through autograd —
one for fwd, plus a 3-kernel backward setup (primary inline kernel
+ a 2-kernel D-split fallback for large D where inline would spill):

| Kernel | Grid | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `_fused_add_norm_fwd_kernel` | 1D over M | fwd: writes `y` + `summed` + `rms_inv` |
| `_fused_add_norm_bwd_inline_kernel` | 1D over M | bwd **primary**: full row per tile, inline inner reduction, writes `d_summed` (+ `dnw_partial`) |
| `_fused_add_norm_inner_kernel` | 1D over M | bwd fallback stage 1: pre-computes `inner[m]` |
| `_fused_add_norm_bwd_kernel` | 2D over (M, D) | bwd fallback stage 2: writes `d_summed` + `dnw_partial` |

### 2.1 Forward kernel

Single-pass design — one program processes one `(BLOCK_M, BLOCK_D)`
tile, loads everything, computes both the reduction and the
per-element output, writes back.

```python
@triton.jit
def _fused_add_norm_fwd_kernel(x_ptr, res_ptr, nw_ptr,
                               y_ptr, summed_ptr, rms_inv_ptr,
                               M, D, eps,
                               BLOCK_M: tl.constexpr,
                               BLOCK_D: tl.constexpr,
                               HAS_NW: tl.constexpr):
    pid_m = tl.program_id(0)
    rows  = pid_m * BLOCK_M + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_M)
    cols  = tl.arange(0, BLOCK_D)
    mask  = (rows < M)[:, None] & (cols < D)[None, :]
    offs  = rows[:, None] * D + cols[None, :]

    x = tl.load(x_ptr + offs, mask=mask, other=0.0)
    r = tl.load(res_ptr + offs, mask=mask, other=0.0)
    summed = x + r
    tl.store(summed_ptr + offs, summed, mask=mask)        # ← for caller's residual stream + bwd

    # bf16 squared products feed an fp32 accumulator via `dtype=`. Saves
    # an intermediate fp32 register tile vs `summed.to(fp32)` and squaring
    # in fp32, at the cost of doing the square in bf16 (precision loss
    # ~1.5e-1, within test atol).
    sum_sq = tl.sum(summed * summed, axis=1, dtype=tl.float32)
    rms_inv = tl.rsqrt(sum_sq / D + eps)               # rsqrt.approx.f32 (one PTX instruction)
    tl.store(rms_inv_ptr + rows, rms_inv, mask=rows < M)  # ← needed by bwd

    y = summed * rms_inv[:, None]                       # bf16 * fp32 → fp32 (auto-promote)
    if HAS_NW:
        nw = tl.load(nw_ptr + cols, mask=cols < D, other=0.0)
        y = y * nw[None, :]                             # fp32 * bf16 → fp32 (auto-promote)
    tl.store(y_ptr + offs, y.to(y_ptr.dtype.element_ty), mask=mask)
```

Patterns to notice:
- **`BLOCK_D = next_power_of_2(D)`** with a `col_mask` to handle
  non-pow2 `D` (nanchat d24 has `D=1536` → `BLOCK_D=2048`, 512 lanes
  masked). Triton's `tl.arange` requires a pow-of-2 length.
- **2D mask** = row mask × col mask, applied to every load/store. Out-of-bounds
  loads return `0` (the additive / multiplicative identity for the
  downstream `sum_sq` — chosen deliberately).
- **`HAS_NW: tl.constexpr`** branches at compile time. The
  no-affine-weight path simply skips the `nw` load + multiply; one binary
  is compiled per `(HAS_NW=True, HAS_NW=False)` value.
- **`element_ty` cast at store** lets the same kernel handle any
  caller dtype (bf16 / fp16 / fp32) without modification.
- **`summed` is written to HBM mid-kernel**, not at the end. This is
  intentional: the caller's residual stream needs the bf16 value, and
  the downstream compute reuses that same bf16 register tile (feeding
  the `tl.sum(dtype=fp32)` reduction and the `summed * rms_inv` step,
  where Triton auto-promotes to fp32) without re-loading from HBM.

### 2.2 Backward path: register budget chooses the kernel

There are two viable backward kernel shapes. Which one runs depends
on whether the **inline** kernel's per-program tile fits the Ampere
255 fp32 reg/thread spill cap. The dispatch lives in
`_fused_add_norm_bwd_impl` and is driven by `TileConfig.fits_reg_budget`.

#### The simple thing first: one kernel, full row per program

The primary path is `_fused_add_norm_bwd_inline_kernel`: a 1D grid
over M with `BLOCK_D = next_pow_of_2(D)` so the **full row** lives in
one tile. The per-row reduction `inner[m] = mean_d(g_eff · y_norm)`
is then computed in registers — no precompute kernel, no inner HBM
buffer, one kernel launch.

This works because at typical nanchat shapes the tile is small:

```
   ~5 fp32 tiles  ×  BLOCK_M  ×  BLOCK_D   /   (num_warps × 32)
                                                    ≤ 255 regs/thread
```

`_pick_tile_config(M, BLOCK_D, n_live_tiles=N)` solves for the largest
BLOCK_M that fits. `N=5` for HAS_NW=True (`y_norm, g_eff, dy_t,
d_ext, d_summed` alive at peak), `N=4` for HAS_NW=False (`y_norm`
aliases `src` and `g_eff` aliases `dy_t` when there's no per-channel
weight). At `D=1536, HAS_NW=True` it picks `BLOCK_M=4, num_warps=8` →
160 regs/thread. At `D=4096, HAS_NW=True` it picks `BLOCK_M=1,
num_warps=4` → also 160 regs/thread. Comfortably under the cap.

#### The bigger gun: 2-kernel D-split fallback

The inline path breaks once `BLOCK_D` is large enough that even
`BLOCK_M=1, num_warps=16` (the cap) overflows. The crossover depends
on n_live_tiles:
- HAS_NW=True (5 live tiles): `BLOCK_D > 16384` (i.e. `D > 16K`) —
  model estimates ≥320 regs/thread, bench confirms ~10× slowdown
  from local-memory spill.
- HAS_NW=False (4 live tiles): `BLOCK_D > 32768` (i.e. `D > 32K`) —
  basically never triggers in any realistic model (nanchat tops out
  at D=8192 even at depth=128).

For those cases the dispatch falls back to a 2-kernel pair that
**splits along D**, dropping the per-program tile back to manageable
size. The same shape choice (`BLOCK_M=32, BLOCK_D=64`) that would
spill at full-D works here because each program only owns a 64-column
slice instead of the full 1536+ row:

```
   5 tiles × 32 × 64  ≈  10K fp32 / program
   10K  /  128 threads ≈ 80 regs/thread       ← fits
```

But splitting along D introduces a new problem. The per-row reduction
`inner[m] = mean_d(g_eff · y_norm)` spans the *whole* D axis — every
d_tile program touching the same m_tile would need this same scalar.
Naïvely each program would loop over all D in pass 1 to compute its
own copy: at `D=1536, BLOCK_D=64` that's a 24× redundant computation.

Following Flash Attention's pre-compute-reduction pattern, the
fallback is two kernels:

**Stage 1 — `_fused_add_norm_inner_kernel`** (1D over M, one
program per `BLOCK_M` rows, processes full D in one tile)
```python
inner[m] = mean_d(g_eff[m, *] * y_norm[m, *])
# writes (M,) fp32 buffer
```

**Stage 2 — `_fused_add_norm_bwd_kernel`** (2D over M × D, each
program handles one `(BLOCK_M, BLOCK_D)` output tile)
```python
inner_m = tl.load(inner_ptr + rows)              # single scalar per row, prebuilt
dx[m, d] = rms_inv[m] * (g_eff[m, d] - y_norm[m, d] * inner_m[m]) + d_ext[m, d]
```

Pass 1 in stage 2 collapses from a full-D loop to a single scalar
load per row. Same total HBM traffic as if we'd done it all in one
kernel (we read `summed`/`dy` once in inner, once in stage 2), but
no redundant per-row reduction.

#### Why we don't just "split D" unconditionally

The 2-kernel fallback was the *only* bwd path in an earlier version
of this kernel — the reasoning at the time was "1D over M will spill,
must split D". That reasoning had a bug: it assumed `BLOCK_M` was
fixed at 32. With `BLOCK_M=32` at `D=1536, num_warps=4` (128 threads):

```
   5 tiles × BLOCK_M=32 × D=1536  ≈  245K fp32 / program
   245K / 128 threads             ≈  1900 fp32 regs/thread
```

**1900 vs 255 cap → catastrophic spill.** So yes, BLOCK_M=32 + full D
spills. But the inline path notices that BLOCK_M is *also* a free
parameter — `_pick_tile_config(M, BLOCK_D, n_live_tiles=5)` derives
`BLOCK_M ≤ 1638·nw / BLOCK_D` (= 256 reg/thread cap ÷ 5 tiles, then
distributed over nw·32 threads) and rounds to a pow-of-2. At D=1536
that drops BLOCK_M to 4 (regs ≈ 160), at D=4096 to 1 (also ≈ 160).
Comfortable, no spill.

Same key idea as the D-split fallback (cut whichever dimension keeps
the tile in registers), just applied to the M axis where each row is
independent and there's no cross-row reduction to worry about. The
fallback only fires when shrinking BLOCK_M to 1 *still* isn't enough —
i.e. when BLOCK_D alone (= full D) blows the budget.

### 2.3 d_summed_external is fused into the bwd kernel

The op returns two outputs (`y`, `summed`), so backward receives two
gradients (`dy`, `d_summed_external`). The first is the norm's output
gradient; the second is from the caller using `summed` directly
downstream.

The naïve setup would compute `d_summed_from_norm` in the bwd kernel,
then do a Python `d_summed_total = d_summed_from_norm + d_summed_external`.
That's an extra torch elementwise op — its own kernel launch (~10-30 μs)
plus a 4·M·D HBM round-trip (~10-15 μs for d24 shape).

Instead, the bwd kernel takes `d_summed_external` as an extra input
and folds the add into the same tile store:

```python
d_summed_tile = rms_inv * (g_eff - y_norm * inner) + d_ext   # ← `+ d_ext` is the fuse
tl.store(d_summed_ptr + offs, d_summed_tile.to(...), mask=mask)
```

Pure register-level add, no extra HBM traffic, no extra kernel launch.

### 2.4 Sizing — applying Chapter 1's budgets

All tile-sized kernels here (fwd, bwd inline, fallback inner) share
one helper for sizing decisions:

```python
def _pick_tile_config(M, BLOCK_D, n_live_tiles) -> TileConfig:
    # Register-budget model (Ampere 255 fp32 reg/thread spill cap):
    #     regs/thread ≈ n_live_tiles × (BLOCK_M × BLOCK_D) / (nw × 32)
    # At the 256-reg target: tile ≤ (8192 / n_live_tiles) × nw
    tile_per_nw = 8192 // n_live_tiles                    # 4096 @ n=2, 1638 @ n=5
    base_nw = 4                                           # initial guess
    BLOCK_M = max(1, min(
        triton.next_power_of_2(max(1, M // 64)),          # M-saturation: grid ≳ 64
        triton.next_power_of_2(max(1, tile_per_nw * base_nw // BLOCK_D)),
    ))
    tile = BLOCK_M * BLOCK_D
    num_warps = max(4, min(16, triton.next_power_of_2(max(1, tile // tile_per_nw))))
    est_regs = n_live_tiles * tile // (num_warps * 32)
    return TileConfig(BLOCK_M, num_warps, est_regs)
```

`n_live_tiles` is the per-kernel knob — peak number of fp32 tiles
alive simultaneously in the hot path:

| Kernel | n_live_tiles | Why |
|---|---|---|
| fwd | 2 | auto-promoted summed-as-fp32 + `y_f32` |
| inner pre-compute (fallback) | 2 | `y_norm` + `g_eff` briefly |
| bwd inline (HAS_NW=True) | 5 | `y_norm`, `g_eff`, `dy_t`, `d_ext`, `d_summed` |
| bwd inline (HAS_NW=False) | 4 | as above but `y_norm`/`g_eff` alias `src`/`dy_t` |

The `TileConfig.fits_reg_budget` property (`est_regs ≤ 256`) is what
`_fused_add_norm_bwd_impl` queries to choose inline vs 2-kernel fallback.

Worked examples at d24 shape (M=2048, D=1536, BLOCK_D=2048):

**fwd (n=2)**: `tile_per_nw = 4096`. BLOCK_M = min(next_pow2(32),
next_pow2(4096·4/2048)) = min(32, 8) = 8. tile = 16K. nw = next_pow2(16K/4096) = 4.
→ `BLOCK_M=8, nw=4`, ~256 reg/thread. Grid = cdiv(2048, 8) = 256
programs.

**bwd inline (n=5)**: `tile_per_nw = 1638`. BLOCK_M = min(32,
next_pow2(1638·4/2048)) = min(32, 4) = 4. tile = 8K. nw = next_pow2(8K/1638) = 8.
→ `BLOCK_M=4, nw=8`, ~160 reg/thread. Grid = cdiv(2048, 4) = 512.

**2-kernel bwd fallback**: uses **fixed config** `BLOCK_M=32, BLOCK_D=64,
num_warps=4` instead of `_pick_tile_config`. Reason isn't perf
(autotune's picks were similar); it's that Triton's autotune dispatch
path retains some operations that don't survive CUDA Graph stream
capture. Hard-coding makes the fallback graph-friendly. Only the
inner pre-compute kernel uses `_pick_tile_config` (with n_live=2).

### 2.5 Numerical precision

This kernel is **close to but not bit-tight** with `F.rms_norm` on
bf16 inputs. PyTorch's `F.rms_norm` internally promotes bf16 → fp32
**before** squaring; we save one register tile by leaving the square
in bf16 and only promoting the accumulator:

```python
# F.rms_norm  : summed.to(fp32) → (fp32 * fp32)² → fp32 sum
# our fwd     : (bf16 * bf16)² → fp32 sum  (via `tl.sum(..., dtype=fp32)`)
```

The bf16-truncated square plus a long-D accumulation drifts about
~1.5e-1 max forward diff on adversarial seeds (well below the
gradient-noise floor on typical inputs). The `test_triton_norm_mlp.py`
bf16 atol is set to 1.5e-1 to allow this.

| Operation | Where it lives | Why |
|---|---|---|
| HBM load of `x`, `r`, `nw` | bf16 (caller's dtype) | Cheaper bandwidth |
| `summed = x + r`, residual-stream store | bf16 in registers | Caller expects bf16 |
| `summed * summed` square | **bf16 in registers** (lossy) | Saves one fp32 register tile |
| `tl.sum(..., dtype=tl.float32)` | **fp32 accumulator** | Prevents long-D mantissa overflow |
| `summed * rms_inv` / `* nw` | **auto-promoted to fp32** | rms_inv is fp32, Triton lifts on multiply |
| Final `y` store | cast back to bf16 | Caller expects bf16 |

**Net register pressure is roughly the same as a fully-fp32-internal
implementation** (fwd kernel: n_regs≈255 at tile=16384, nw=4) — the
auto-promote in `summed * rms_inv` materializes an fp32 tile anyway;
we save the SSA name of the explicit `summed_f32` intermediate but not
the underlying register. The bf16 path is about HBM dtype compatibility,
not register savings.

> Want strict bit-parity with `F.rms_norm` instead? Add `summed.to(tl.float32)`
> before the square (costing one register tile, matching the fully-fp32
> implementation). The current code chose the precision-vs-register
> tradeoff that's worth more in practice.

### 2.6 Expected savings — HBM and launch ledger

Before measuring, work out what fusion should save on paper. The
short version: **forward saves a real HBM round-trip; backward
primary (inline) path also saves bytes; backward fallback (2-kernel)
saves launches and intermediate buffers but not HBM bytes**.

#### Forward

Naive native (two ops: `summed = x + r`, then `y = F.rms_norm(summed)`):
```
torch.add (x + r → summed):
  read x        M·D
  read r        M·D
  write summed  M·D
F.rms_norm (summed → y):
  read summed   M·D                     ← this is what fusion eliminates
  write y       M·D
─────────────────────────────────────────
Total:          5·M·D
```

Fused (one kernel):
```
read x          M·D
read r          M·D
write summed    M·D    (caller residual stream still needs it)
write y         M·D
─────────────────────────────────────────
Total:          4·M·D
```

Net forward savings:
- **HBM: 1·M·D bytes** — the `summed` value never leaves registers
  between `x + r` and the norm reduction.
- **Kernel launches: 1** (two ops collapse to one Triton kernel).
- **Intermediate buffer: 1** (no separate `summed` allocation for
  the torch.add output).

For d24 (M=2048, D=1536, bf16): 1·M·D = 6.3 MB / 936 GB/s ≈ 6.7 μs
of HBM time, plus ~10-30 μs of avoided launch overhead.

#### Backward

Backward has two kernel paths (see §2.2 for the dispatch). Common
case is the **inline single-pass kernel**; the **2-kernel D-split
fallback** only engages when the inline tile would exceed the 255
reg/thread cap (HAS_NW=True at D > 16K; HAS_NW=False at D > 32K
which essentially never triggers). Ledger them both.

Both compare against PyTorch-optimized native. The math itself needs
two reductions over D (`inner[m] = mean_d(dy · y_norm)` and then
`dx = rms_inv · (dy − y_norm · inner)`), so "1 read" below assumes
the **1-pass shared-memory pattern** PyTorch ships: one CUDA block
per row, load `summed` and `dy` into shared mem once, reduce there,
then revisit shared mem for the per-element `dx`. D=1536 fp32 +
dy = 12 KB / row, easily fits in 3090's 100 KB / SM shared-mem
budget. A literally-naive 2-pass implementation (write `inner` to
HBM, re-load `summed`/`dy` for the second pass) would double the
read bytes — call it out if you ever benchmark against one.

All ledgers below assume `HAS_NW=False` (no learnable affine weight,
which matches nanchat's setup — see `nanchat/gpt.py:9`). HAS_NW=True
adds a `dnw_partials` write (~M·D fp32, larger in inline since
BLOCK_M is smaller there) + a `.sum(dim=0)` reduction (~M·D read,
~D write) on both fused paths, and a separate per-channel dW kernel
(~2·M·D read, ~D write) on native — roughly cancels out in
comparisons, so the relative wins stay the same.

Native (1-pass shared-mem + Python accumulation of external grad):
```
F.rms_norm.backward (1-pass shared-mem):
  read summed              M·D
  read dy                  M·D
  write d_summed_from_norm M·D                              ─┐
                                                             │ subtotal 3·M·D
Python d_summed = d_summed_from_norm + d_summed_external:
  read d_summed_from_norm  M·D
  read d_summed_external   M·D
  write d_summed_total     M·D                              ─┘ subtotal 3·M·D
─────────────────────────────────────────
Total:                     6·M·D
```

##### Path A — Inline (primary): bytes + launches + buffer win

The inline kernel fits the full row in one tile (`BLOCK_D = next_pow_of_2(D)`)
and computes `inner` in registers, no precompute kernel, no inner
HBM buffer. `d_summed_external` is folded into the kernel's d_summed
store via a register-level add — same trick as the 2-kernel path:

```
_fused_add_norm_bwd_inline_kernel:
  read summed/y            M·D
  read dy                  M·D
  read d_summed_external   M·D
  write d_summed           M·D
─────────────────────────────────────────
Total:                     4·M·D
```

Net inline savings vs native:
- **HBM: 2·M·D bytes** — no `d_summed_from_norm` intermediate
  flowing through HBM (the kernel computes the norm gradient and
  folds in `d_ext` inside the same row's registers).
- **Kernel launches: 1** (one Triton kernel vs PyTorch's
  `rms_norm.backward` + Python add).
- **Intermediate buffer: 1** (no `d_summed_from_norm` allocation).

For d24 (M=2048, D=1536, bf16): 2·M·D = 12.6 MB / 936 GB/s ≈ 13 μs
of HBM time saved, plus ~10-30 μs of avoided launch overhead. This
matches the symmetry with forward — both fwd and bwd primary paths
get the clean three-way win.

##### Path B — 2-kernel fallback: bytes tie, launches still saved

When inline would spill (HAS_NW=True at D > 16K, see §2.2), the
dispatch falls back to the 2-kernel pair. The split-D structure
**can't** use the 1-pass shared-mem trick — no single program owns
a full row — so we read `summed`/`dy` twice (once in inner, once
in bwd):

```
_fused_add_norm_inner_kernel:
  read summed/y            M·D
  read dy                  M·D
  write inner_buf          ~0  (M floats)                   ─┐ subtotal 2·M·D
                                                             │
_fused_add_norm_bwd_kernel:                                  │
  read summed/y            M·D   ← repeat read (L2 likely hits)
  read dy                  M·D   ← repeat read (L2 likely hits)
  read d_summed_external   M·D
  read inner_buf           ~0
  write d_summed           M·D                              ─┘ subtotal 4·M·D
─────────────────────────────────────────
Total:                     6·M·D    (= native)
```

**Bytes tie native** — fused reads `summed`/`dy` twice (2·M·D each)
where native reads them once, but native's separate `+` kernel adds
back a 3·M·D round-trip on `d_summed_from_norm`. Net: even. Wins
shrink to:
- **1 intermediate buffer**: no `d_summed_from_norm` (same as inline).
- **1 kernel launch**: trade native's Python add for the
  inner-precompute kernel — net launch count ties native, but the
  fused launches are closer together (better L2 reuse on the repeat
  reads in the bwd kernel).

#### Takeaway

| Path | bytes | launches | buffer |
|---|---|---|---|
| Forward fused | ✓ save 1·M·D | ✓ save 1 | ✓ save 1 |
| Backward inline (primary) | ✓ save 2·M·D | ✓ save 1 | ✓ save 1 |
| Backward 2-kernel (fallback) | — tie | ~ tie (trade) | ✓ save 1 |

The lesson: **whenever you can re-use values from a previous step
in registers instead of round-tripping through HBM, that's a real
bandwidth saving**. The inline path does exactly that for both fwd
and bwd. The 2-kernel fallback is forced to re-read `summed`/`dy`
because the per-program tile can't hold a full row — but that
fallback only fires when the alternative (catastrophic register
spill) would be much worse.

### 2.7 Performance reality

Measured at d24 fwd-only (M=2048, D=1536, bf16, HAS_NW=False) on
RTX 3090:

| Mode | fused | native | ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| Kernel-only timing (direct kernel launch, no autograd) | **~72 μs** | ~88 μs | **fused 1.22× faster** |
| Plain eager `fused_add_norm(...)` call (fwd-only) | ~163 μs | ~88 μs | fused 1.85× *slower* |
| Plain eager `fused_add_norm(...) + backward` | ~1075 μs | ~618 μs | fused 1.74× *slower* |

The eager-mode slowdown is **not** the kernel itself — it's the
`autograd.Function` + Triton dispatch overhead per call (~90 μs of
fixed cost per fwd: tensor allocs, `save_for_backward`, ctx setup,
kernel launch arg packing). This overhead vanishes inside CUDA Graph
capture or a larger `torch.compile`-wrapped pipeline.

Bigger shapes flip the verdict: at `M=2048, D=4096` (also fwd+bwd,
HAS_NW=False) fused wins **1.21×** end-to-end. The crossover is where
the kernel's actual GPU work exceeds the ~90 μs framework overhead.

The fundamental lesson: **for kernels this short, Python framework
overhead can easily exceed the kernel's actual GPU work**. A
single-op `torch.compile(fused_add_norm)` makes things *worse*
because the compile dispatcher adds its own overhead. The fusion
only pays off when:
1. The op is invoked inside a larger model wrapped in
   `torch.compile(model)` so the dispatcher overhead is amortized, OR
2. The whole training step is `torch.cuda.CUDAGraph`-captured so the
   per-call Python work happens only at capture time.

This is the same reason production transformer kernels are
*bigger* (Flash Attention covers the whole `Q@K^T → softmax → @V`
chain, not individual ops): kernel launches and Python dispatchers
are constant per-op overhead, so longer kernels win on amortization
even if their per-element throughput isn't faster than a chain of
small kernels.

That's also why nanchat's production path skips this kernel:
`fused_mlp_block` and `NormQKVProjection` fold the norm directly
into the matmul kernel, so there's no standalone op-boundary call
that this `add+norm` fusion could attach to. This kernel exists to
demonstrate the patterns; the bigger production kernels are where
the patterns pay off.
